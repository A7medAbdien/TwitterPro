# Twitter Dashboard

this project helps to answer, what I can twit today? The Dashboard will show...
1. the most liked tweets
2. the tended tweets/ as a hashtags
3. what the user followers liked yesterday

# Concepts

1. using social media API
2. extracting features/insights from the tweets
3. data visualization

# Might add

google trends for the most trends, But IDK how this might help?!

# My process will be

1. request access to Twitter api - 3/26 
2. set backend and frontend services - 3/27
3. start using Twitter api - as soon the Twitter give the access
4. building the frontend, dashboard
5. set a database
