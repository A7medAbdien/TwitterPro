# Intro

Hi,

This website "analyze" Elon Mask Twitter account, but it can works on any other account.

There is no specific goal for the website, except FUN and I am a fan of Elon. So, I would like to know more about him.

A Great man said:
Saying that you have data analysis skills is another way of saying that could be a good stalker.

Some constraints on the data:

1. the data only for the last week
2. there is a limit on how mush data the website can gets per minute

So lets Go..

# Outline

I will try to answer four main questions:
1. What
2. When
3. Who
4. What is Common between him and his friends. (I will take the assumption that his friends will be his followings)

So what I will be concerned about...

1. His Tweets
2. His Replies
3. His Likes
4. His Following Likes

The analysis can go farther for
5. His Following Tweets
6. His Following Replies

but I felt it is too much, let us keep this for someone else.ðŸ˜‰

-- This is really feels ocurred, but the data is out there anyone can do this


# Frequent Terms

Here I am answering the What questions,
1. What his Tweets about
2. What his Replies about
3. What his Likes about
4. What his Followings Likes about

By counting how mush a term appears in his Tweets, we can get a sort of test what he talks about. 
I felt that Single Terms (Uni-gram) will not be enough to give meaningful insights, so I added Coupled Terms (Bi-gram)

Noting that I ignoring stop-words like, and, or, is.. etc.
and considering words like, play playing or played as one word "play" (Limmtizing)


# Frequent Topics

Twitter sometimes analysis the tweets, and suggest what they are about.
Here is another way of answering the What questions,
1. What his Tweets about
2. What his Replies about
3. What his Likes about
4. What his Followings Likes about


# Times of Tweets and Replies

1. When he Tweets

The reason for not adding "When he Likes a tweet", is... I am too lazy to do it.ðŸ˜‡

Here I am answering the Who questions,
1. Who he replies to
2. Who he likes their tweets
3. Common Accounts he Replies and Likes their tweets
4. Common Accounts he and his followers Likes their tweets
